# Math311_Linear_Algebra_Projects

This is a repository of projecrs for the Math 311 Linear Algebra course at Winona State University. It uses Google Colab and coding in Python to explore linear algebra concepts.

# Projects:
1. Solve Systems using Colab and Python
   Using Google Co-Laboratory to introduce the idea of solving systems of equations with code:
